    <h1>Housing Price Prediction: Exploratory and Predictive Analysis</h1>
    
<p>
        This project focuses on understanding the key factors influencing housing prices and building machine learning models to predict them accurately. 
        Using a comprehensive dataset of residential properties, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Gain insights into housing price distributions and correlations with features like size, location, and quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Handle missing data, perform normalization, and encode categorical variables for effective modeling.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Create and evaluate new features to enhance prediction accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Train and evaluate models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Ridge, Lasso, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).</li>
        <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Assess performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Technologies and Tools:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Regression models, feature importance analysis, and hyperparameter tuning.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Results:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Visualizations of housing market trends and influential features.</li>
        <li>A trained predictive model capable of estimating house prices with high accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Usage:</h2>
